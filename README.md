# QA

### I want this compiled for Mac/Linux!

I don't have access to these systems right now and can't properly test and compile my program to see if it will even run. However, if you want to try and see if my program will work on those systems, please try! I would love to port to those systems, but I'm too limited to be able to fully try it. If it works completely, let me know, I would love to supply Mac and Linux with this software too.
